        <h3>Description:</h3>
            <p>
                This recipe for Chinese pork belly is named after 
                an ancient Chinese statesman, poet, and gourmand 
                of the Song Dynasty. The pork is cooked three 
                different ways, rendering the meat succulent, tender, 
                and very flavorful. If you can't find pork belly, 
                ask the butcher; it is what bacon is before it is 
                cured and sliced.
